This is a simple project that began from watching Brackey's YouTube video:
	"How to make a Video Game - Godot Beginner Tutorial"
	
This project is a 2D platformer that displays:
	- Player, with controls derived from the default script
	- GameManager to keep score (collecting coins)
	- Collectables (aforementioned coins)
	- Killzone, which manages falling of screen and running into an enemy
	- Text in world
	- Audio in the form of SFX and Music

Ideas for extended learning:
	- Expand the level
	- Add effects, animations and effects for coin collection
	- Add danger, traps that turn on and off
	- Main menu
	- Power-ups
	- GameManager for scene loading
	+ Player movement
		- Coyote time
		- Double jump
